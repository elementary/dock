Description: Elegant, simple, clean dock
 Plank is a dock enabling you to start applications and manage your windows.
 .
 Plank is meant to be the simplest dock on the planet. The goal is to
 provide just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more. It is,
 however, a library which can be extended to create other dock programs
 with more advanced features.
